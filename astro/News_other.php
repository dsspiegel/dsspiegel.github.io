	Several other brushes with "fame" were interesting but didn't lead to internet-based evidence:

	During my visit to Belgrade, Serbia, for a conference celebrating the 130th anniversary of Milutin Milankovitch's birth (I was the only attendee talking about <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...721.1308S" target="_blank"><b>Milankovitch cycles in exoplanetary systems</b></a>), I was interviewed for an hour by a fellow who said he was from "Science Radio Serbia," an entity of which there's not a single trace known to Google.  He promised to send me an mp3 of the interview, but he never did.  (Later at this conference, I was invited to meet the Crown Prince of Serbia and had <a href="imgs/palace_s.jpg" target="_blank">dinner at the palace!</a>)  Anyway, I never found out what that interview was actually for.

	Also, several years ago, I particularly enjoyed spending 3 hours with a BBC crew on a Harlem basketball court for program called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1851900/" target="_blank"><b>"Do We Really Need the Moon"</b></a> in which I had about 30 seconds of (uncredited) screen time (I mean this sincerely &mdash; the process was fascinating, although the basketball analogy that the producers came up with to justify shooting on a basketball court was dubious). I was on the show to talk about how the presence of the Moon affects the Earth's longterm climate and habitability (related to the topic of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...721.1308S" target="_blank"><b>Spiegel+ 2010</b></a> and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...691..596S" target="_blank"><b>Spiegel, Menou, & Scharf 2009</b></a>).
